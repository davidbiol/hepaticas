\title{Prunes a phylogenetic tree to include only a specified set of genera}
\usage{
tree_by_genus(genus_vector, input_tree, tolerance = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{genus_vector}{A character vector containing the names of the genera
that should be retained in the new tree. These names must exactly match
tip labels in the input_tree.}

\item{input_tree}{An object of class 'phylo' representing the input phylogenetic tree.}

\item{tolerance}{A number representing the tolerance of character edits for each element of genus_vector input. tolerance = 0 means there is a perfect word match. Default is 2 (i.e. 2 character edits is the maximum tolerance).}
}
\value{
A new 'phylo' object containing only the specified genus, or NULL
        if an error occurs (e.g., no common genus found).
}
